this was written for professor messer's network+ and security+ course

https://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-601/sy0-601-video/sy0-601-comptia-security-plus-course/

at the link above, he lists each video along with its time length so while studying the material I wrote a script to 
pick out just the times and to give me an estimate of how long each section would take.

to use it, just copy paste the video titles with times into text.txt
